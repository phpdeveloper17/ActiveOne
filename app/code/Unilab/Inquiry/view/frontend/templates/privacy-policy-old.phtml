<h4>Privacy Policy</h4>

<div class="std">
<div class="psslai-content-box">
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this privacy policy in order for you to understand how we<br /> collect, use and disclose and make use of personal information. By agreeing to activate your account with us, you expressly<br /> agree to this privacy policy.</p>
<p>The following outlines our privacy policy principles.</p>
<p>Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.<br /> We will collect and use of personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other<br /> compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law. We will only retain personal<br /> information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes. We will collect personal information by lawful and fair<br /> means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned. Personal data should be relevant to<br /> the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and <br /> up-to-date. We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized<br /> access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and<br /> practices relating to the management of personal information.</p>
<p>We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the privacy of<br /> personal information is protected and maintained.</p>
<p>In this regard, we will only collect personally identifiable data, such as your name, address, telephone number, fax number,<br /> or e-mail address, and medical information (if necessary), when you voluntarily submit them to us upon activation of your account<br /> in order to avail of the services being offered in our site. We will use this information to perform the services, such as fulfilling your<br /> orders and, as may be necessary, to contact you in relation thereto. We will not sell or otherwise transfer any personally <br /> identifiable information that you have provided us to any third party unless otherwise disclosed to you beforehand and only after<br /> securing your consent, except that we may release such information to: (1) our affiliates, partners and authorized agents in order<br /> to effectively perform the services being offered; (2) any person under a duty of confidentiality to us; and (3) any person to whom <br /> we are required to make disclosure under any applicable law or by reason of a court order. We may also use the information<br /> disclosed to us for studies, statistical and other research purposes provided always that the identity of the person will be kept <br /> strictly confidential. We will also seek to take appropriate steps so that the personal information will not be retained longer than is<br /> necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which the information is to be used unless we have obtained your consent to use<br /> it for other purposes from those herein mentioned.</p>
<p>You can access or correct any factual errors in all your personal identifiable information that we collect online by logging into <br /> your account and changing your information or by contacting us via the Contact Us menu link on the site and requesting us to<br /> assist you. To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or<br /> correcting errors.</p>
<p><strong><span>Privacy in Linked Sites</span></strong></p>
<p>Our site may contain links to a number of sites that we believe may offer useful information to you. However, the privacy <br /> policies and procedures described in the immediately preceding paragraph may not apply to those sites. We, therefore, advise<br /> that you contact those sites directly or read their own privacy policies for information on their data collection and distribution<br /> policies.</p>
<p>We reserved our right to amend and revise this privacy policy from time to time to comply with existing laws, rules and <br /> regulations, orders and other issuances.</p>
